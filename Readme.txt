##   Objective  ##
##################


One of the key findings observed during the research is that Twitter does not collect the gender information as do the other social media sites, which makes "Gender Prediction on Twitter" an interesting concept to understand the difference in the writing patterns between males and females. 
This interesting thought intrigued me to develop a machine learning model via this project that would help identify the gender of the author based on different features like combination of tweets and user description or features like user name, sidebar color, profile    link color and image.

3) numpy
4) pandas
5) time
6) matplotlib
7) wordcloud
8) re
9) operator

Based on tweets and description of user on Twitter,
LinearSVC classification model helped acheive an accuracy of 69.5% in predicting the gender of the author.
